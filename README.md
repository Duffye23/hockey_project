# Creating a Neural Network to Predict Point Production in the NHL

For our final project, Danik and I chose to answer the question "Can we create a model that can accurately predict a player's point total?" </br>

To answer this question we chose to try three different machine learning algorithms and decide which of the three would be the most accurate. The models we chose to use were:

1. A linear regression model: We chose to run a Linear Regression as it is a prediction based algorithm that is able to take in our features and use them to predict our dependent variable. Though simple in terms of machine learning algorithms, it can beused to great effect.
2. A random forest model: Another form of regressor, the random forest algorith applies nuremours decision trees for added accuracy. We decided to test this one out as it was another model that we had learned in class and found that it more robust than the linear regression
3. A Neural Network: The most advanced model we learnt in class, this was added for its complexity and customizability.
